API Integrations on Cuuro.ai allow other apps to access your workspace programmatically. This is useful for integrating Cuuro with other tools and services.


<Tip>Cuuro API keys are prefixed with `cuuro_` for easy identification.</Tip>

## API Integrations

You can create as many API integrations as you need, each with its own API token.
